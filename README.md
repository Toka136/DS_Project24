Home Décor Fantasy Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Home Décor Fantasy application! This project is aimed at creating an interactive platform where users can engage in a fantasy home décor competition. Players will have the opportunity to decorate a room within a set budget using products from various décor stores. Users can rate products, influencing their prices, and ultimately determining the top-ranked player in the competition.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User Management: Each player is assigned a unique ID, username, password, budget, and decoration set. A minimum of three players must participate.

Décor Stores: Multiple décor stores are available, each with a unique ID, name, list of products, and corresponding prices.

Admin Control: An admin user has the authority to manage data entry, removal, and updates of stores and products.

Competition Mechanics:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players start with a default budget of 80K and aim to decorate a room.
Players can buy, sell, or replace products within their budget, with the budget updating accordingly.
Search functionality allows players to find products, displaying relevant information such as store, ratings, and price.
Users can add, update, or remove ratings/points for products, influencing their prices.
The rankings are based on the ratings received by players' decoration sets.
Products' prices fluctuate based on the points awarded by users.
At the end of the competition, the top-ranked player is displayed.
